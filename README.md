# Algorithms

This repository contains the work required and work done for 5 labs and the final for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. 
In each lab folder you will find, at least, the requirements for the lab and the .cpp file associuated with it. Some requirements are 
provided as .txt files. My personal favorite is the binary data structure and search. I find it a simple, less complex way to store data
and it is very fast to search through and find data.
